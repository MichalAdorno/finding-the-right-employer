## Notes

When you start looking for a programming job your first priority should be to find a company where they will take your skills to a professional level.

If someone has told you that programmers come out of school ready to work they have lied to you, a junior developer fresh out of school knows nothing about professional grade programming and much as a doctor you are going to need hands on training before you start to understand how things really work.

Finding the right company is a lot more important than your salary the first few years because once you know how standard application development works and you are just another programmer in the industry you will be able to get a new job fairly easy and that will give you market value which translates in to higher salary.

### What companies to contact

The first thing to think about when you start looking for a job is what companies to contact.

#### Rule of thumb 1

A good rule of thumb is to look for larger product companies, these are companies who have a system that is making them money and they are looking for full time developers to join their teams.

The reason behind this is that larger product companies have the resources to train juniors and they are likely to have people who will become your mentors and this is critical if you want to learn how to be a professional.

#### Rule of thumb 2

Consultancies is a bit of a risk early in your career but can also work very well, a personal check you should make is if you are working in a team or in isolation, if you are working in isolation it is a good indicator that you need to find another company, as a junior you really need other professionals that give you feedback and share their experience.

### What to do before contacting the company

Before you reach out to a company or you respond to a recruiter do some basic research about the nature of their business, a quick search will give you the company size and a understanding for what type of application development they do.

#### Rule of thumb 3

Always look at open job positions and read the tech skills the company is asking for, the tools the company uses will tell you a lot about what culture the company has.

#### Rule of thumb 4

If the tools are "old" the company is likely a conservative company, this is not a bad thing.

If you are unsure about what tools are relevant in the industry you need to research that before you contact the company, you want to work where the tools are fairly relevant to what the rest of the industry is using but it doesn't have to be cutting edge, you will still learn a lot.

#### Rule of thumb 5

If the tools are all super trendy and the company is a small startup be aware that the company is likely young and there is a high chance that you will have less experienced coworkers and limited time with hectic work conditions and little in terms of standard process.

This is where you likely will get to do the most, small companies rarely have the funds to hire specialist so they require their programmers to "know everything".

### The interview process

Once you have gotten in contact with a company that seems promising you should ask to meet at least one developer from the team you will work in at some point.

This is important in order for you to get a feel for what type of people are working at the company and it will give you a chance to ask your own questions.

#### Rule of thumb 6

Show a genuine interest in your craft so you can ask open questions that forces your future coworkers to answer with their own opinions.

Examples could be:

* "I really love ..., do you have anything in IT that you get excited about?"
* "I understand that you are really good at ... what is your favorite feature?"
* "How do you onboard new people, do you do any pair programming?"

These sorts of questions will give you insight in to the sort of people who are working in your team, if they like what they do and how likely they are to enjoy collaboration.

In the beginning you will have tons of questions and everything will be new so it is vital that you figure out if the people who will mentor you will be the sort of people you will feel comfortable with when you need help, if you are afraid to talk to them or they don't care about their work you will become isolated even if your are part of a team.

### Final word

* Always make sure that you know the nature of the company before you interview
* Always find out what tech stack the job has
* Always talk to your future team members during the interview

Once you have a few years under your belt you can do whatever you want but in the beginning you are likely going to need support from other developers so finding a company that understands and can provide this is one of the best starts in your career that you can get.

Good programmers are not born they are made.
